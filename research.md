# Research

I study the mathematical foundations of the Navier–Stokes equations—essential but still not fully understood equations that describe how fluids like air and water move. These equations are central to modeling everything from weather patterns to industrial fluid systems.

My research explores three main areas:

- **Regularity & Well-Posedness:** When and how solutions exist, behave smoothly, and depend predictably on initial data.
- **Singularity Formation:** Understanding if and how extreme behaviors (like infinite velocity) can form in finite time.
- **Global Behavior:** Finding conditions under which solutions remain stable and well-defined for all time.

By combining techniques from nonlinear partial differential equations, harmonic analysis, and modern mathematical inequalities, I aim to improve our theoretical understanding of fluid motion and contribute to long-standing open problems in turbulence and fluid dynamics.
