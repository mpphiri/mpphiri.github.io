# About Me

I am a PhD student in Applied Mathematics at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, specializing in Applied Analysis and Nonlinear PDEs in Fluid Dynamics and Turbulence. My research focuses on regularity theories for the Navier–Stokes equations, with applications to incompressible fluid models.

## Research interests
- Applied analysis and nonlinear PDEs
- Fluid dynamics and turbulence
- Navier–Stokes regularity and singularity formation
- Harmonic analysis techniques and modern inequalities
