    <div class="kicker">PhD Student in Applied Mathematics | Applied Analysis, Nonlinear PDEs, Fluid Dynamics</div>

    I am a PhD student in Applied Mathematics at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, specializing in Applied Analysis and Nonlinear PDEs in Fluid Dynamics and Turbulence. My research focuses on regularity theories for the Navier–Stokes equations, with applications to incompressible fluid models.

## Overview

I study the mathematical foundations of the Navier–Stokes equations—essential but still not fully understood equations that describe how fluids like air and water move. These equations are central to modeling everything from weather patterns to industrial fluid systems.

## Research themes

- **Regularity & Well-Posedness:** When and how solutions exist, behave smoothly, and depend predictably on initial data.
- **Singularity Formation:** Understanding if and how extreme behaviors (e.g., infinite velocity) can form in finite time.
- **Global Behavior:** Conditions under which solutions remain stable and well-defined for all time.
